    <string name="story_1">Loud knocking to the door woke you up in the morning. On the threshold you saw the confidant
        of the king. He kindly invited you to the Royal Palace, saying that the matter is urgent. The king himself is
        waiting for you.\n Approaching the Royal palace, you wonder why the king needs to talk to a simple blacksmith…
    </string>
    <string name="story_2">My loyal subject, for the last time, my health began to weaken, and my sworn enemy King
        Bruenor from the southern lands is very powerful and aggressive.\n The Kingdom is in danger. If I die and the
        southerners come upon us, many innocent citizens of my Kingdom will perish.
    </string>
    <string name="story_3">Beyond the dry lands, on the East, the dark wizard lives. He possesses secret and powerful
        spell. If you come back with this spell, the Kingdom can be saved. You are known as one of the best blacksmiths
        of the Kingdom, your hand is strong and your will is like a steel. I ask you to do this favour for me.
    </string>
    <string name="story_4">The king has blessed you and wished you not to surrender in the face of difficulties. You
        have left the Palace and are ready to start the journey.
    </string>
    <string name="story_5">You\'ve come to the Eastern gates of the city. At the gates you met a guard who is interested
        in where you are going.
    </string>
    <string name="story_6">You told the guard about your plans to go beyond the Arden forest. He is very concerned about
        your story, and wishes you the help of the Almighty God.
    </string>
    <string name="story_7">No one has entered the Arden forest for many years. Rumor has it that at night there is a
        huge howl from the wolves, and at dawn you can meet the dead mermaids floating in the forest mist. Behind the
        Arden forest there are dry lands where you will give all your gold for a drop of water.
    </string>
    <string name="story_8">You came out to the East to the big valley. You enjoy fine weather, a light wind breezing
        blowing and birds sing. You have two days journey to the Arden forest through the valley.
    </string>
    <string name="story_9">The Great valley is beautiful, but you have long way to go.</string>
    <string name="story_10">You have passed the green valley and reached the edge of the Arden forest. There are many
        bad rumors about this forest, it\'s time to check which of them are true.
    </string>
    <string name="story_11">You passed some distance in the woods before dark. Strange rustling is heard around, in the
        distance you hear lingering howl of wolves. You need to sleep, but how to do it in such a disturbing
        environment?
    </string>
    <string name="story_12">You need to fall asleep in order to have the strength to continue the trip tomorrow.
    </string>
    <string name="story_13">In the dream you see a dark forest. The moon shines brightly through the trees. In the haze
        dark silhouette with a scythe is approaching you. The silhouette swings his scythe and screams \"Haaarrrrgh\".
    </string>
    <string name="story_14">Waking up, you see a big muscular wolf right in front of you. The wolf bared his teeth and
        prepares to attack.
    </string>
    <string name="story_15">You run away, dodging between trees, but the wolf does not lag behind and quickly overtakes
        you.
    </string>
    <string name="story_16">Wolf catches you up and knocks you down. Now you see the hungry eyes and bared teeth.
    </string>
    <string name="story_17">You grab a sharp stick, which lies next to you, and stab it into the wolf\'s throat. Blood
        splatters from the wound, and the wolf with a squeal jumps out of the way.
    </string>
    <string name="story_18">You grab the wolf by the tongue and pull it with big force. Wolf jumps out of the way with a
        squeal, the blood pouring from his mouth.
    </string>
    <string name="story_19">You leave the Arden forest, and on one of the trees in the distance you see a carved
        inscription. You wonder what is written there, but the wolf could still be somewhere nearby.
    </string>
    <string name="story_20">On the tree the inscription is engraved:\n \"It is a rough road that leads to the heights of
        greatness\".
    </string>
    <string name="story_21">You see a calm river in front of you. Looking around, you can\'t see the crossing on foot.
        Apparently, to continue the path you\'ll have to soak your feet.
    </string>
    <string name="story_22">Already passing the middle of the river, you see a strange movement aside. You turn around
        to understand the source of this movement.
    </string>
    <string name="story_23">You realize that the huge alligator is approaching you fast.You swim fast, but the alligator
        is even faster. You need to collect all your power not to stay at the bottom of this calm river forever.
    </string>
    <string name="story_24">You spent the night away from the river. In the morning you can see dry lands stretching for
        miles in front of you. The earth is all cracked from dryness. A small pitcher of water here will be more
        expensive than gold.
    </string>
    <string name="story_25">You are on the road for a few days, and the end of these dried up lands is still not
        visible. You\'re exhausted by heat and thirst. You want to lie down for a few hours, but you know you\'ll never
        get up.
    </string>
    <string name="story_26">You continue your trip through the dry lands. You notice the skull of some animal laying on
        the ground. This land of death always takes its toll.
    </string>
    <string name="story_27">You take the skull in your hands, when suddenly a snake crawls out of the orbit and bites
        you.
    </string>
    <string name="story_28">You take out an oblong flask with water from an eye socket. You drink all the water, and
        immediately feel an inflow of forces.
    </string>
    <string name="story_29">You went a few more miles through the dry lands. You need to collect all the forces not to
        die right here. Suddenly you hear scary sounds from the sky.
    </string>
    <string name="story_30">You lift your head and you see a big desert eagle flying right at you, exposing its claws. A
        few more seconds, and it will take you to the place, from where no one has returned.
    </string>
    <string name="story_31">The desert eagle rushes towards you.</string>
    <string name="story_32">You bounce to the side, and the eagle catches you with claws, cutting clothes and skin. You
        grab a stone lying on the ground, and when the eagle comes again, you beat it with a great force.
    </string>
    <string name="story_33">Your clothes are covered in blood. The eagle managed to tear your shoulder and chest. But
        the wounds don\'t seem dangerous.
    </string>
    <string name="story_34">Cautiously looking up to the sky, you have two days more continued the path through the dry
        lands. Finally, when the sun has already begun to set behind the horizon, you have reached the foot of the Dalai
        mountains.
    </string>
    <string name="story_35">In the morning you see all the splendor and power of the mountain chain in front of you.
        Mountains stretch for kilometers, going beyond the horizon. There is no workaround, you need to overcome the
        mountain.
    </string>
    <string name="story_36">Overcome the Dalai mountain</string>
    <string name="story_37">The ascent was very hard. The cold wind blew right through to the bones. You tried not to
        look down, but sometimes you had to, and then the blood run cold. But now you are one of the few mortals who
        overcame the Dalai mountains.
    </string>
    <string name="story_38">You heard about this land from your grandfather, but it seems even he believed this is just
        a fairy tale. You see the red lands going beyond the horizon.
    </string>
    <string name="story_39">The ground around you is red from the heat. Sweat blinds your eyes, the heat makes you hard
        to breathe. The ground burns the feet even through the shoes. You have no more strength to go, but you remember
        the king\'s speech and his request…
    </string>
    <string name="story_40">Overcome the Red hot land</string>
    <string name="story_41">You\'ve almost reached the end of the red lands. And then you see a strange illusion. A huge
        ferocious dragon stands right in front of you. His claws dug into the hot ground and his nostrils are distended.
        It makes a loud roar that fills everything.
    </string>
    <string name="story_42">Dragon easily exhales a thin stream of fire that burns your hand. Slowly the consciousness
        returns to you and you realize that the dragon is real. You realize that you\'re going to die. And at this
        moment you think that the dragon is fabulously beautiful.
    </string>
    <string name="story_43">Defeat the dragon</string>
    <string name="story_44">You stand still and look right into the dragon\'s eyes. Inside them you feel an ancient
        power. It seems that the dragon is studying you, touches the darkest corners of the soul. Suddenly, the dragon
        lowers his head in humility and clears your way.
    </string>
    <string name="story_45">You see a wonderful land in front of you. The arch of a beautiful rainbow shines in the sky.
        Fields of fragrant flowers are spreading around. The Golden road leads you to a strange-shaped castle made of
        material unknown in your area.
    </string>
    <string name="story_46">You come to the castle, and an old man in long clothes blocks your way. You can hear that
        he\'s greeting you, but it looks like he didn\'t open his mouth. The words just sounded in your head.
    </string>
    <string name="story_47">Suddenly you feel that you can\'t move and talk. Something very ancient is affecting you.
        The old man bewitched you!
    </string>
    <string name="story_48">Overcome the spell</string>
    <string name="story_49">It seems your will has become so strong, that helped you overcome ancient spell. You can
        move and talk again.\n\n You say:
    </string>
    <string name="story_50">The old magician says to you:\n " Stranger, don't be angry at me. Different people come
        here, and many of them have a dark soul. My spell can be overcomen only by those who have strong will and pure
        thoughts."
    </string>
    <string name="story_51">The magician replies to you:\n "I see you're a man of strong will. I have something for you.
        This is the Sword of a thousand truths. If he falls into the hands of a man with very strong will, then he can
        crush the whole army."
    </string>
    <string name="story_52">Take the Sword of a thousand truths</string>
    <string name="story_53">You\'ve come a long way. It\'s time to go home. You will bring victory to your people. You
        will bring with you not only a magic sword, but also your steel willpower.
    </string>
    <string name="story_54">You see a big old chest on the side of the road. It is inscribed in a language you do not
        know.
    </string>
    <string name="story_55">You find some strange stone inside. When you look at it, words are heard in your head: "You
        are only as lazy or lacking in willpower as you think you are."
